## Dupleek singhambeef troup lee

This is a small C++ project created as an experiment while learning and practicing C++ programming. The project contains simple logic and examples inspired by the idea of **Dupleek Singhambeef Troup Lee** and related variations.

The main goal of this repository is learning, testing ideas, and having some fun with code.

---

## What this project includes

* Basic C++ source files
* Simple program structure
* Practice with functions, conditions, and loops
* Multiple example `.cpp` files

This project is not meant to be production-ready — it’s mainly for practice and understanding how C++ programs work.

---

## Files in this repository

* `Dupleek singhambeef troup lee.cpp` – Main program file
* `Bista poor cubilla and flipper tobik sita.cpp` – Additional example file
* `README.md` – Project information
* Other folders contain supporting files or notes

---

## How to run the code

Make sure you have a C++ compiler like **g++** installed.

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

Replace `filename.cpp` with the file you want to compile.

---

## Why I made this

* To practice C++ basics
* To experiment with different ideas in code
* To keep my learning projects in one place

If you’re also learning C++, feel free to look through the code and try modifying it.
